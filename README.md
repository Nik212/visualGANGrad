# Visualizing gradient directions of generative models

This is the repository dedicated to a course project done for Machine Learning course at Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology. 

**The goal** of our empirical study is too understand how the knowledge of the gradient of the divergence with respect to the generator can be applied to improving the quality of generated data (in our case, imagese) 

For details, please see our presentation or report.
